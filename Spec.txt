Calculate the cost in movement points for a unit to move from one hex, to an adjacent one.

Ignoring the ocean for now

The movement point cost is based on the target hex, not the current one. This is modified in a number of different ways.

Hex types:
Each requires a base 1 MP, except as noted
Coast, Desert, Grassland, Hills (2 MP), Mountain (Impassable), Plains, Snow, Tundra

Hex modifiers:
If a hex has one of these modifiers it replaces the base MP cost
Fallout: 2 MP
Forest: 2 MP
Ice: Impassable
Jungle: 2 MP
Marsh: 3 MP

Rivers:
A river can exist *between* 2 hexes. If there is one, crossing it uses all remaining movement points
	- except if there is a road in both hexes and the player has discovered Engineering

Railroads:
If a railroad exists in both source and target hex, MP cost is 0.1, regardless of terrain

If a road exists in both source and target hex, MP cost is 1/3 MP, regardless of terrain

The base cost is 1 MP
If the target hex is a mountain, it is impassable 
	- except if the player is Byzantium
	- except if the unit is a flying unit

Unit promotions:
	- woodsman promotion, half cost for woods or jungle

Unit attributes:
	'ignores terrain cost' attribute, every hex is 1 MP (but impassable ones are still impassable)
	'altitude training' attribute, double movement in hills
	'bonuses in  snow, tundra and hills' attribute, double movement in snow, tundra and hills
	'cannot enter forest of jungle' attribute, cannot enter those 
	'hovering unit' may pass over a mountain
	'rough terrain penalty' - entering 'rough terrain' (MP cost > 1) costs all movement
